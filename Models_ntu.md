# Behind the scene of machine learning 

- Part 1. Techniques on Features tranforms
	
	- 1. Kernel models: put the feature transform in a kernel model
	
		**Kernels**
		
		- polynomial kernel
		
		- Gaussian kernel: infinite-dim transforms
		
		- Stump kernel
		
		**Lemma**
		
		- Sum of kernels is kernel
		
		- Product of kernels is kernel
		
		- Math condition: Mercer condition
		
		** Kernel with other linear models into non-linear models**
		
		- SVM
		
		- SVR
		
		- probabilitistic SVM
