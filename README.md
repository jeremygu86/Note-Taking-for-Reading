1. They are highly **unstructured**. They not not useful for understanding the nature of the relationship between the features and the outcome class.

2. Nearest neighbor work well in low-dimensional data. Nearest neighbor also work well in regression for low-dimensional problems. 

- In the high-dimensional data, the bias-variance tradeoff doesn't work as well for NN regression as it does for classification.
